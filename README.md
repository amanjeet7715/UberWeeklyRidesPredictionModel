# UberWeeklyRidesPredictionModel

It is a Uber Weekly Rides Prediction App.

This project is all about a Machine Learning based Uber Weekly Rides Prediction web app which makes predictions about weekly rides on various cities on the basis of the required variables as PricePerWeek, Population, MonthlyIncome and AverageParkingPerMonth using the concept of machine learning.

In this project, I have developed a simple Uber Weekly Rides Prediction App which is using a weekly rides Predictor api to provide us the weekly ride details of any city.

For Developing the project I have used Flask Framework as base. I have used HTML and CSS for developing basic structure of the project. All the coding part is implemented using Python Language.


## Tools used for project development:

    * Python ( 3.7 version)

    * Flask

    * Pandas

    * Numpy

    * HTML

    * CSS

### For using the project use the following commands :

    * $ git clone
    * $ set FLASK_APP= app.py
    * $ flask run
    
The whole project is deployed on Heroku Cloud.
